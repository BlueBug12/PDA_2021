Problem:
1. How to store the original cluster and recover after each try? => store the cluster vector in row
2. How to know how many space each row remains to place a new cell? => don't need to know. If fail, just recover the original vector
3. How to compute cost? =>ã€€the displacement of placed cell()
4. How to choose row? => use binary serach to find the closest row(in height)
5. Where to store nodes? => in row
